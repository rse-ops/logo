This project is part of [RADIUSS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/radiuss), which
has a focus on helping open source scientific projects use best practices for
automation and development.

This is a playground for creating different RADIUSS logos, and keeping
track of source files.  We've taken the [original](original) logo and flattened
it a bit to generate the contents of [text](text) that are used across this
GitHub organization. For each separate project, we have a subfolder that
includes a similarly styled icon for that project. Logos for projects
can be browsed here, or seen across the project.
