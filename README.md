# RSE-ops Logos

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://github.com/rse-radiuss/radius-docker/blob/main/LICENSE)

This is a playground for creating different RSE-ops logos, and keeping
track of source files.  For each separate project, we have a subfolder that
includes a similarly styled icon for that project. Logos for projects
can be browsed here, or seen across the project.


## Design

### Font

The rse-ops projects logo uses the [Orbitron](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron?preview.text=rse-ops&preview.text_type=custom&category=Sans+Serif,Display,Monospace) font, medium.
The raw files are in [fonts](fonts) to install to your system. On Linux, you can
usually click the ttf file and open with "Fonts" to install.

### Colors

The colors used in the project are:

 - #741755 (RSE purple)
 - #005dab (LLNL blue)
 - white or gray (secondary)
